# Yakub_Capstone_Project
The goal of this research project is to develop an advanced analytical framework and an optimal machine learning predictive model that leverages historical and real-time climate data to enhance the accuracy of renewable energy production forecasting. Specifically, this framework aims to identify patterns in weather conditions (e.g., solar radiation, wind speed, temperature, and humidity) and predict energy output from renewable sources such as solar and wind power.
By employing data-driven insights, this project seeks to improve energy grid stability, optimize resource allocation, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. The effectiveness of the model will be measured through forecast accuracy metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² scores), with the goal of achieving at least 85% accuracy in energy production predictions.
This research can be completed by one person within a timeframe of 3 to 6 months, depending on the availability of existing datasets (e.g., NASA, NOAA, NREL) and computational resources. The successful implementation of this model will contribute to enhanced renewable energy planning and a more sustainable energy future.
